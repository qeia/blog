      <description>Iâ€™m no medical professional nor do I have any prior personal experience with COVID19 or any related pandemic. The last serious one in my country was Swine Flu and I was in my teens at that time.
But allow me to make some predictions, Mark My Words style.
Predictions  At least 3 types of vaccines will be developed and used worldwide and problems will be found in all of them The vaccines will be known to help only certain people (say a good 95% of them) but only for a short while.</description>

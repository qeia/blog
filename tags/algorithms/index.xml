      <description>What is shortest path? If you are already familiar with what Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm intends to do then skip this section.
A graph, for those who are unfamiliar or have forgotten, is just a collection of ordered pairs of “points” which are also called edges. These pairs of points may have a distance associated with them in which case they are known as “weighted”.
Given a graph with positive weights and a source “vertex” i.</description>

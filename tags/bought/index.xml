      <description>The Good I didn’t realise this at first, but the FireTV is actually some sort of a skin on Android TV I think and this brings in the same familiarity and customisability. Something I long forgotten existed since my recent shift to the Apple ecosystem. It’s worth pointing out that the FireTV posed no performance issues and I faced stutters only occasionally.
The FireTV was extremely simple to set up and start and zero compatibility issues with my TV.</description>
